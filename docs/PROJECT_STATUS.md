# StellarForge — Current project status

**Version:** 1.6.0 · **Updated:** 2026-11-05 · **Engineering status:** active, tested · **Scientific status:** unverified Gaia–ZTF source associations.

## Implemented

- Full Python package, command-line utilities, tests, continuous integration and research documentation.
- 387/387 automated tests passed in GitHub Actions on the v1.6 research branch (5 November 2026).
- Pinned secondary Taurus catalog audit: 532 adopted members, 467 Gaia identifiers; 24-object technical seed.
- Two official IRSA ZTF cone-query responses near FT Tau and CIDA 11 on 5 November 2026, totaling 2,212 rows across six distinct ZTF OIDs; integrity hashes and failures are logged.
- Reproducible SHA-checked **provisional Gaia-to-ZTF per-epoch screen** for all six OID/passbands; median positional separations ~0.063–0.092 arcsec (not independently verified identities).
- Independent Gaia DR3 TAP 15-arcsec sky-field queries around FT Tau and CIDA 11 both returned only the target Gaia source; **this does not rule out non-Gaia or unresolved contamination**.
- Gaia DR3 RUWE values: FT Tau 1.3266, CIDA 11 8.5675. The latter is an astrometric-fit quality concern, not proof of binarity.
- Official science/reference ZTF cutout links and header transport probes in v1.4 (intermittent HTTP 503).
- **v1.5 real FITS pixel screening:** 5 of 6 ZTF OID-band groups had real FITS pixels opened and celestial WCS checked (3 science frames, 2 reference coadds); all five show a local maximum within 0.5 arcsec of Gaia's approximate position.
- **v1.6 local Gaussian image-shape screening:** three FT Tau individual science images passed bounded single-Gaussian-plus-background fitting. All three have high model residuals and require further review; no CIDA 11 fits and no OID/filter with two independent usable science images in this execution. The fit is not an independently calibrated PSF.
- Scientific data integrity gates: distinct OIDs/bands, flag masking, hashes, time-scale handling, provisional astrometric checks and synthetic-only benchmarking.

## Not yet established

- Independent Gaia/ZTF source identity or confirmed physical variability.
- Publisher-original Taurus catalog byte verification.
- Empirical calibrated ZTF PSF models, source deblending, uncertainty-calibrated backgrounds, independently validated FITS WCS, multiple usable science epochs, full Gaia covariance/parallax, non-Gaia neighbours and field-star controls for these ZTF sources.
- Real-survey detection completeness, false-positive rate or representative disk-class sample.

## Public portfolio boundary

The repository may be viewed as *research software in development*. Do not interpret provisional code outputs, observational cone-search rows or synthetic benchmarks as claims of astrophysical discoveries. Raw third-party photometric downloads must remain outside Git until legal/provenance/reuse constraints are reviewed.

## Next scientific milestone

**Next science gate:** compare real images to independently measured same-field stellar PSFs, quantify WCS calibration residuals, and retrieve independent science epochs under a controlled archive-request budget; resolve CIDA 11 high RUWE and non-Gaia contamination.
